## **Youssef Abbih – Python Backend Developer & Tooling Enthusiast**

Hi, I’m Youssef 👋 – a Python Backend Developer and Automation Engineer with a passion for building developer tools and backend systems. I specialize in **automation, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines**, and enjoy designing solutions that improve workflows, reduce downtime, and scale efficiently.  

I thrive on taking projects from **concept to production**, whether it’s scripting, API development, or creating CLI tools for developers.

### 🔧 **Tech Stack & Tools**

**Languages:** Python, Go, C  
**Frameworks:** Django, Dash, Plotly  
**Automation & DevOps:** Ansible (AWX), Jenkins, Docker, GitLab CI/CD  
**Monitoring & Observability:** Zabbix, Prometheus  
**Cloud & Containerization:** Kubernetes (EKS), AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda)  
**Networking & APIs:** REST APIs, NetBox, IP Fabric  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL  
**Other Tools:** Git, Jira, Confluence, VSCode  

### ✨ **Highlights**
✅ Engineered Zabbix monitoring templates that reduced network downtime by 20%, enabling real-time infrastructure alerting and faster issue resolution.

✅ Built a Python pipeline for interactive network maps (Pandas, IP Fabric API, NetBox), increasing end-to-end network visibility by 40% and saving hours of manual work.

✅ Optimized CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, Kubernetes) and automated deployments with Ansible/AWX, accelerating release cycles and ensuring smooth production rollouts.
